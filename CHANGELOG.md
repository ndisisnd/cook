## [pending] — 2026-05-21 · Flutter refs: resolve conflicts and fill gaps

**Fixed two critical conflicts and three gap/cross-reference issues across `standards/flutter/refs/`. No content deleted; all changes are additive edits or priority demotions.**

- `refs/navigation.md` — Added "Router Decision Rule" table at top; demoted GetX Navigation from P0 to P1 (HIGH), resolving the dual-P0 conflict with go_router
- `refs/state-management.md` — Renamed BLoC state template headings (Union ✅ PREFERRED, Flat ⚠️ LIMITED USE, Equatable ⚠️ LEGACY); inserted "Which to use" guidance block between Union and Flat sections
- `refs/architecture.md` — Added "Which Architecture to Use" decision table at top with 5 criteria and an explicit default ("Feature-Based for new projects")
- `refs/design-system.md` — Added idiomatic `Row(spacing:)` note to Spacing section with ✅/⚠️ examples and cross-reference to SKILL.md § P1 Idiomatic Flutter
- `refs/security.md` — Added `SecurityModule` DI snippet after raw `FlutterSecureStorage()` example; added cross-reference to `refs/dependency-injection.md § Third-Party Modules`
- `refs/error-handling.md` — Added scoping note to Repository Error Mapping section pointing to `refs/networking.md § Token Refresh Pattern` for global HTTP concerns

## [pending] — 2026-05-21 · Consolidate flutter domain into single-skill structure

**Collapsed 22 flutter sub-skill folders into one `SKILL.md` + 13 topic refs, matching the dart/graphql exemplar shape. All superseded files are preserved in `archive/flutter/` for review.**

- Created `standards/flutter/SKILL.md` with always-on P0 rules (design system, error handling) and P1 rules (widgets, idiomatic Flutter, performance), plus a References section listing all 13 refs
- Created 13 flat refs under `standards/flutter/refs/`: `state-management`, `navigation`, `architecture`, `networking`, `error-handling`, `dependency-injection`, `design-system`, `localization`, `notifications`, `security`, `concurrency`, `cicd`, `testing`
- Merged conflicting go_router skills (`flutter-navigation` P1 + `flutter-go-router-navigation` P0) into a single unified go_router section in `refs/navigation.md`
- Carried forward 3 previously orphaned refs: `dls-modular-pattern.md` and `monolithic-pattern.md` into `refs/design-system.md`; `repository-mapping.md` into `refs/architecture.md`
- Confirmed 5 broken `REFERENCE.md` indexes (dangling targets that never existed) — no content carried; files preserved in archive
- Regenerated `standards/flutter/_INDEX.md` to AUTO-GENERATED format with File Match table, Loading Instructions, and Archived section referencing `archive/flutter/`
- Moved all 22 `flutter-<name>/` folders to `archive/flutter/` (repo root) using `git mv`, preserving full history; no files deleted
- `cook/SKILL.md` Flutter row already resolves to `standards/flutter/_INDEX.md`; no change required

## [56c3d70] — 2026-05-21 · Align skill-routing with keyword-driven model

**Fixed a dangling reference left in the review skill routing after the keyword-driven refactor.**

- Rewrote `standards/review/refs/skill-routing.md` to drop the `--frontend`/`--backend`/`--full-stack` mode flags and match concern refs via `standards/global/_INDEX.md` instead
- Replaced the mode-flag table with a Surface-to-Skills Mapping (concern refs + domain skills, additive union)
- Updated worked examples to load specific concern refs instead of mode-flag invocations
- Added §6 "Post-Verification Audit" to `verify-[6].md` and moved it into `verify/done/`

---

## [d290dac] — 2026-05-21 · Make cook a keyword-driven orchestrator

**cook now detects what a task touches by keyword and composes standards from concern refs — mode flags are gone.**

- Rewrote the top-level `SKILL.md` as a keyword-driven orchestrator: receive summary → detect review intent → extract keywords → load global P0 → match concern refs → detect domains → compile
- Removed the `--frontend`/`--backend`/`--full-stack` mode flags and the P1 mode section from `standards/global/SKILL.md`
- Converted `standards/global/_INDEX.md` into a Concern Match table (keyword + file pattern → concern ref)
- Folded the frontend/backend layer rules into concern refs: `architecture.md`, `security.md`, `performance.md`

---

## [d679bf1] — 2026-05-21 · Add changelog and verify-[6] plan

**Introduced a root changelog and captured the next verification plan as a standalone artifact.**

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` to track notable repository changes in reverse chronological order
- Added `verify/verify-[6].md` with the verification plan for the latest standards restructuring work

---

## [93f14d2] — 2026-05-20 · Consolidate standards into domain-based structure

**All skill files and references are now organized by domain — one skill entry point per domain, shared refs in a flat folder.**

- Merged separate PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis skills into a single `standards/database/SKILL.md`
- Moved all database reference files into `standards/database/refs/` with vendor prefixes (e.g. `postgresql-best-practices.md`, `redis-checklist.md`)
- Collapsed all global sub-skills (api-design, architecture, code-review, coding-principles, debug, error-handling, owasp, performance, security-audit, security-standards) into a single `standards/global/SKILL.md` backed by consolidated `standards/global/refs/` files
- Added a new React consolidated `standards/react/SKILL.md` with full refs: component-patterns, performance, security, state-management, testing, tooling
- Added GraphQL refs for testing and tooling
- Moved completed verification artifacts into `verify/done/`

## [46aa432] — 2026-05-20 · Update review skill routing

**Small update to wire the new code review skill into the global index.**

- Updated `standards/global/_INDEX.md` to reference the new review skill
- Updated `standards/global/code-review/SKILL.md` with routing adjustments
- Updated `standards/review/SKILL.md` trigger language

---

## [4415cda] — 2026-05-20 · Add findings-first code review skill

**A new structured code review skill that outputs findings before explanations.**

- Created `standards/review/SKILL.md` — the main review skill definition
- Created `standards/review/_INDEX.md` — index for review standards
- Added reference files: `finding-severity.md`, `report-format.md`, `review-lenses.md`, `skill-routing.md`
- Added `review-plan.md` — the review workflow plan
- Updated root `SKILL.md` to include the new review skill

---

## [da88c8a] — 2026-05-20 · Reorganize TypeScript and add global standards

**TypeScript skills are consolidated into a single skill; global standards directory added.**

- Added `.gitignore`
- Updated Dart skill and its refs (testing, tooling)
- Added `standards/global/SKILL.md` and `standards/global/_INDEX.md` — new top-level global standards entry point
- Added unified `standards/typescript/SKILL.md` replacing four separate sub-skills
- Added new TypeScript ref files: `security.md`, `testing.md`, `tooling.md`
- Removed old TypeScript sub-skill directories: `typescript-best-practices`, `typescript-language`, `typescript-security`, `typescript-tooling`
- Added `verify/verify-[1].md` — first verification artifact

---

## [aeb9765] — 2026-05-19 · Rename context folders to refs

**Every skill's supporting files moved from `context/` to `refs/` — cleaner, more descriptive naming.**

- Renamed all `context/` directories to `refs/` across all skill domains: dart, database, flutter, global, graphql, nextjs, react, typescript
- Updated all `SKILL.md` files to point to `refs/` instead of `context/`
- No content changes — purely a folder rename
