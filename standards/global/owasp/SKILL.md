# OWASP Top 10 Security Checklist

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Always-Apply Rules

Apply these on **every code write**, not during dedicated security reviews:

- **No IDOR**: Filter every resource query by `owner_id` or `tenantId` alongside any user-supplied ID. `findById(params.id)` without owner filter immediate P0.
- **No wildcard CORS**: Restrict to explicit allowlisted origins — never `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on authenticated routes.
- **No full entity return**: Always project to DTO — never serialize raw ORM output to API response.

## Context-Specific Checklist

Activate when: writing security-sensitive features, reviewing PRs, or doing codebase audits.

Mark each item: ✅ not affected | ⚠️ needs review | 🔴 confirmed finding.

**P0 finding caps Security score at 40/100.**

Apply framework-specific security skills alongside this checklist.
See [refs/owasp-web.md](refs/owasp-web.md) and [refs/owasp-api.md](refs/owasp-api.md) for full detection signals.

### OWASP Web Application Top 10 (2021)

| ID | Risk | Key Detection Signal |
| --- | ---- | -------------------- |
| A01 | Broken Access Control | `findById(params.id)` without owner filter. Route without `@authorize`. |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | Weak hash (MD5/SHA1) for passwords. HTTP URL hardcoded. No TLS. |
| A03 | Injection | String concat in DB queries. Unsanitized input to templates. XSS. |
| A04 | Insecure Design | No rate limiting on auth. Missing input validation at entry points. |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | CORS `*`. Debug mode in prod. Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS). |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | CVE in dependency audit. Unreviewed new direct dependency. |
| A07 | Auth Failures | JWT without expiry. No session invalidation on logout. |
| A08 | Data Integrity Failures | Unverified JWT/cookie. Deserialization of untrusted input. |
| A09 | Logging & Monitoring | No audit log on: deletion, password change, privilege escalation. |
| A10 | SSRF | HTTP client with user-controlled URL and no allowlist. |

### OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)

| ID | Risk | Key Detection Signal |
| ----- | ---- | -------------------- |
| API1 | Broken Object Level Auth (BOLA) | Resource by user-supplied ID without `AND owner_id = currentUser`. |
| API2 | Broken Authentication | JWT missing `exp`. Token not revoked on logout. Bearer in URL. |
| API3 | Broken Property Level Auth | Full ORM entity returned. No DTO projection. Mass assignment. |
| API4 | Unrestricted Resource Consumption | No server-enforced `limit`/`pageSize`. No throttle on heavy ops. |
| API5 | Broken Function Level Auth | Admin route reachable without role guard. |
| API6 | Unrestricted Business Flow | No verification on OTP/checkout/password-reset flows. |
| API8 | Security Misconfiguration | Stack trace in response. CORS `*` on authenticated routes. |
| API9 | Improper Inventory Management | Deprecated/undocumented endpoints still reachable. |
| API10 | Unsafe API Consumption | Third-party response used without schema validation. |
